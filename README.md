Molly Guard for RHEL

Protects machines from accidental shutdowns/reboots


This is a port of molly-guard from Debian to RHEL and derivatives.

Original page: http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/molly-guard


It was ported by (I'm assuming) Lazarus at:

I didn't want the code to disappear some day, so I decided to upload it to github.
